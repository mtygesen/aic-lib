# Algorithms in C++
## General
The point of this repository is to get a better knowledge of algorithms, and of more advanced c++ concepts. Additionally this repo will also contain some algorithms that is not included in the standard c++ library, which could come in hand at some point.

All the algorithms are implemented as header only, so they are easier to use in programs.

To use the full library include the following header:
```cpp
#include "algorithms-in-cpp/algo.hpp"
```

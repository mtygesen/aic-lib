# Algorithms in C++
![CTest](https://github.com/icecoldgold773/algorithms-in-cpp/actions/workflows/cmake-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

## General
The point of this repository is to get a better knowledge of algorithms, and more advanced c++ concepts. Additionally, this repository will also contain some algorithms that are not included in the standard c++ library, which could be useful at some point.

All the algorithms are implemented as a header-only library, so they are easier to use in programs.

The library folder should be placed at the same destination as the source file using the header.

To use the full library include the following header:
```cpp
#include "algorithms-in-cpp/algo.hpp"
```

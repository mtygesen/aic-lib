## General

This library is implemented as a header-only library, so you do not need to link any source files.

The library includes several algorithms and data structures, including some that are not found in the standard c++ library.

## How to use

To use the library in your project place the library folder relatively to your source file and include it with:

```cpp
#include "adic/adic.hpp"
```

# Algorithms in C++
![CTest](https://github.com/icecoldgold773/algorithms-in-cpp/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

## General
The point of this repository is to get a better knowledge of algorithms, and more advanced c++ concepts. Additionally, this repository will also contain some algorithms that are not included in the standard c++ library, which could be useful at some point.

All the algorithms are implemented as a header-only library, so they are easier to use in programs.

To use the full library include the following header:
```cpp
#include "algorithms-in-cpp/algo.hpp"
```
